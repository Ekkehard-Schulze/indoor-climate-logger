1-Wire temperature logger for Linux systems
-------------------------------------------

This Python script uses the Linux kernel driver for temperature readings. 

The 1-Wire bus enables multiple temperature sensors on a single long cable.

The Linux kernel auto-discovers 1-Wire temperature sensors on startup.

You can connect different types of sensors to the same bus. The kernel 

supports 1-Wire sensor types DS18S20, DS1822, DS18B20,  DS28EA00,

MAX31850, and DS1825. The latter two read type K thermocouples,

whereas the others are semiconductor sensors.

The script writes a tab separated value formated text file with 

ISO 8601 date and time. This format is compatible with python's pandas 

and plotly packages as well as with spreadsheet processing. 

The script either logs temperature measurements with its own timer,

or, alternatively, records a single data frame, suitable for periodic 

calls by the cron deamon.

For example, this crontab line invokes a data frame recording every 15 minutes: 

*/15  * * * *    /home/user_name/bin/1-Wire-temperature-logger-RPi.pyw -q    >/dev/null 2>>/dev/null

Moreover, a further script provides graphical data analyzis and statistics.

The 1-Wire bus can power sensors using 'external power'

(three wires) or 'parasite power' (two wires).

This script was only tested using external power.

To use 1-Wire sensors with a Raspberry Pi, activate the 1-Wire bus 

via raspi-config. The default Raspberry Pi GPIO pin for 

1-Wire communication is GPIO4. You need a 4.7kΩ resistor 

between the data line and 3.3 volt. 





Notes
-------

1.) To see the command line options use './1-Wire-temperature-logger-RPi.pyw -h'

2.) Read the 'user settings' (lines 87 to 130) and modify these according to your needs.

3.) The file name extension '.pyw' prevents the opening of a terminal window in case

you invoke the script as a cron job.

4.) You might be interested to have a look at [Timo Furrer's w1thermsenso package](https://pypi.org/project/w1thermsensor/)

to learn about more sophisticated techniques to interrogate 1Wire temperature 

sensors using the Linux kernel driver, which are actually not used here.

An eight-meter long 1-Wire bus cable with six DS18B20 sensors connected to a RaspberryPi3B+

was used to document mercury arc lamp usage in a lab for two years.

Four type K thermocouples connected via 1-Wire bus to a RaspberryPi3B+ using MAX31850 amplifiers

allow to measure temperatures ranging from -200°C to 1200°C with the MAX31850 interface.
